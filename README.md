# Sms-spam-Detection
Undertook this project to learn about how, Emails, texts, and other documents can be verified on the ground level to catch AI-generated and spam texts. Built a working frontend where the same can be checked by inputting text messages to verify if the messages are spam or not spam. 

I created a function that removes, common sentence formers, like the, it, they, he, she, etc. Split the text message into sentences, words, and further characters. 
Based on that I trained Multiple models over spam detection datasets taken from kaggle. 

Models Used:
1. KNN
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Logistic Regression
4. Random Forest
5. AdaBoost Classifier
6. Bagging Classifier
7. Extra Tree Classifier
8. Gradient Boosting Classifier
9. XGB CLassifier
10. Naive Bayes

The naive Bayes classifier Outperforms all other models based on precision and accuracy results.
